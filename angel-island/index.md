Angel Island Immigration Station, operating from 1910 to 1940, served as the primary point of entry and detention for Chinese immigrants during the Exclusion Era. The island itself became a carceral landscape where immigration enforcement, environmental isolation, and human experience intersected.

## The Immigration Station

Located in San Francisco Bay, Angel Island was chosen for its isolation—making escape difficult and quarantine possible. The station processed approximately 175,000 Chinese immigrants, many of whom were detained for weeks, months, or even years while immigration officials interrogated them and reviewed their paperwork.

## Detention Poems

        Chinese detainees carved poems into the wooden walls of the detention barracks, expressing their frustration, hope, and despair. These poems, discovered in the 1970s, provide powerful testimony to the human experience of exclusion:

> "Imprisoned in the wooden building day and night,  
> My freedom is withheld; how can I bear to talk about it?  
> I look to see who is happy but they only sit quietly.  
> I am anxious and depressed and cannot fall asleep.  
> The days are long and the bottle constantly empty; my sad mood, even so, is not dispelled.  
> Nights are long and the pillow cold; who can pity my loneliness?  
> After experiencing such loneliness and sorrow,  
> Why not just return home and learn to plow the fields?"

## Interrogation Procedures

Immigration officials subjected Chinese immigrants to extensive interrogations designed to catch inconsistencies in their stories. Detainees were asked detailed questions about their home villages, family members, and daily life. These interrogations often lasted hours and were repeated multiple times, with officials comparing answers to detect fraud.

### Paper Sons and Daughters

Due to exclusion laws, many Chinese immigrants entered using false identities as "paper sons" or "paper daughters"—claiming to be children of U.S. citizens. The elaborate interrogation system was designed to expose these false claims, creating a cat-and-mouse game between immigrants and officials.

## Environmental Context of Isolation

Angel Island's geography shaped the detention experience:

- **Island Isolation:** Surrounded by water, the island created a physical barrier that reinforced the legal and social exclusion of Chinese immigrants.
- **Quarantine Functions:** The island's isolation made it suitable for medical quarantine, with officials using health inspections as another tool of exclusion.
- **Natural Environment:** Detainees could see the San Francisco skyline and the freedom it represented, while being confined to the island's barracks and exercise yards.

## Preservation and Memory

In the 1970s, park ranger Alexander Weiss discovered the Chinese poems carved into the barracks walls. This discovery led to efforts to preserve the site as a National Historic Landmark. Today, Angel Island serves as both a state park and a memorial to the exclusion era, with restored barracks and interpretive exhibits.

## Legacy and Environmental Justice

Angel Island represents how environmental spaces can be weaponized for exclusion. The island's isolation, combined with legal exclusion, created a carceral landscape that physically separated Chinese immigrants from the mainland and from full participation in American society. This history connects to broader themes of environmental justice, where marginalized communities face disproportionate environmental burdens and limited access to resources.
