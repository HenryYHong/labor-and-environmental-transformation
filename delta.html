                <h2>Levee Construction</h2>
                <div class="row g-4 mb-4">
                    <div class="col-md-7">
                        <p>Beginning in the 1860s, Chinese workers moved vast quantities of earth by hand to erect levees throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Working in mud, tidal currents, and extreme heat, they constructed barriers that drained wetlands and enabled farming. The work was backbreaking and dangerous, requiring workers to dig, carry, and pack earth using only hand tools, baskets, and wheelbarrows.</p>
                        
                        <p>Levee construction required building stable foundations in water and mud, creating barriers that could withstand tidal forces and seasonal flooding. Workers built levees by layering earth, packing it down, and creating slopes that would resist erosion. The work was continuous, as levees required constant maintenance and repair due to erosion, storms, and subsidence.</p>
                        
                        <p>Maintenance crews—often the same laborers who built the original levees—worked year-round to repair damage from storms, erosion, and animal burrows. This ongoing work created a permanent labor force in the Delta, with Chinese workers developing specialized knowledge of local hydrology, soil conditions, and levee construction techniques.</p>

                <h3>Scale and Scope</h3>
                <p>By the early 20th century, Chinese workers had built hundreds of miles of levees, converting over 500,000 acres of wetlands into agricultural land. This massive transformation required moving millions of cubic yards of earth, redirecting waterways, and creating entirely new landscapes. The scale of this work is difficult to overstate—it represents one of the largest human-made environmental transformations in California history.</p>

                <h2>Hydrological Transformation</h2>
                <p>The levee system fundamentally altered the Delta's water systems, creating changes that continue to affect the region today. Levees and pumps removed tidal flows from thousands of acres of wetlands, eliminating critical habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife. The drained wetlands had served as nurseries for salmon and other fish, filtering water, storing floodwaters, and supporting diverse ecosystems. Their elimination fundamentally altered the Delta's ecology. The loss of wetlands also affected nutrient cycles, water quality, and carbon storage. Wetlands naturally filter pollutants, absorb excess nutrients, and store carbon in their soils. Draining these wetlands released stored carbon into the atmosphere and eliminated natural water filtration systems.</p>
                
                <p>Rivers and channels were straightened, narrowed, and redirected to facilitate drainage and navigation. This channelization accelerated water flows, increased erosion, and changed sediment delivery patterns. The modified channels no longer supported the natural processes that had maintained the Delta's ecology for thousands of years. The altered channels also affected fish migration, as salmon and other species could no longer access spawning grounds or follow traditional migration routes. The loss of side channels, sloughs, and backwaters eliminated critical habitat for juvenile fish and other aquatic species.</p>
                
                <p>Agricultural runoff from the reclaimed land, combined with reduced wetland filtration, affected water quality throughout the Delta. Pesticides, fertilizers, and sediment from farming operations entered waterways, affecting fisheries, drinking water supplies, and ecosystem health. The altered hydrology also changed salinity patterns, affecting both agricultural and ecological systems.</p>

                <h2>Delta Communities</h2>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>Chinese farmers established settlements throughout the Delta, including Locke, Isleton, Walnut Grove, and smaller communities on various islands. Despite legal restrictions on property ownership, they created vibrant cultural, economic, and social networks that supported agriculture and local markets.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Locke, California</h3>
                        <p>Locke is perhaps the most well-known Chinese community in the Delta. Established in 1915, it was built by and for Chinese residents who were excluded from living in nearby towns. The community developed its own businesses, schools, social organizations, and cultural institutions, creating a unique cultural landscape that persists today as a National Historic Landmark.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Community Organization</h3>
                <p>Delta Chinese communities organized through family associations, tongs, and mutual aid societies. These organizations provided social support, economic assistance, and cultural continuity. They also helped coordinate agricultural work, manage tenant relationships, and navigate legal restrictions.</p>
                
                <p>Despite exclusion from property ownership, Chinese communities in the Delta developed sophisticated systems for managing agricultural production, marketing crops, and maintaining community cohesion. These systems enabled survival and growth despite legal and social restrictions.</p>

                <h2>Subsidence &amp; Risk</h2>
                <p>Draining peat soils caused oxidation and compaction, a process that continues today. When wetlands are drained, the organic matter in peat soils oxidizes, releasing carbon dioxide and causing the soil to compact and sink. This subsidence has pushed many Delta islands 10–20 feet below sea level, making them entirely dependent on levees for protection. Subsidence continues today at rates of up to several inches per year on some islands. This ongoing sinking increases the height difference between islands and surrounding waterways, putting greater pressure on levees and increasing flood risk. The subsidence also affects infrastructure, including roads, buildings, and agricultural operations.</p>
                
                <p>Climate change and sea level rise intensify the Delta's vulnerability. Rising sea levels increase the pressure on levees, while changing precipitation patterns affect both flood risk and water availability. The combination of subsidence, sea level rise, and climate change creates a perfect storm of environmental risk. The Delta sits near several active fault lines, including the Hayward and San Andreas faults. Earthquakes could cause levee failures, leading to catastrophic flooding. Many Delta levees were built over a century ago and were not designed to withstand modern seismic standards. The combination of aging infrastructure, subsidence, and seismic risk creates ongoing vulnerability.</p>

                <h2>Tenant Farming &amp; Exclusion</h2>
                <p>Alien Land Laws prevented Chinese immigrants from owning the land they reclaimed, creating a paradox where Chinese labor built agricultural infrastructure but Chinese farmers could not own the land they helped create. Chinese farmers worked under short-term leases and sharecropping arrangements that limited their ability to make long-term investments. Without property rights, they could not secure loans for improvements, invest in soil health, or build permanent infrastructure. This created economic precarity and limited environmental stewardship.</p>
                
                <p>Despite restrictions, Chinese farmers developed innovative techniques and introduced new crops. They specialized in labor-intensive crops like asparagus, strawberries, and specialty vegetables, using methods that maximized yields from small plots. However, without property rights, they could not fully benefit from these innovations or pass them on to future generations. The exclusion from property ownership created ongoing economic and social challenges. Chinese farmers could not build generational wealth through land ownership, limiting economic mobility and community development. This exclusion also affected social status and political power, as property ownership was often tied to citizenship and voting rights.</p>

                <h2>Contemporary Delta Challenges</h2>
                <p>The Delta today faces multiple environmental challenges that connect to its history of transformation. Massive water export systems pump Delta water to Southern California and the Central Valley, affecting Delta hydrology and ecosystems. These exports reduce freshwater flows, increase salinity, and affect fish populations. The infrastructure for water export—including pumps, canals, and reservoirs—was built on the foundation of the levee system that Chinese workers constructed.</p>
                
                <p>Efforts to restore wetland habitats conflict with agricultural interests and water export needs. Some proposals call for flooding reclaimed islands to restore wetlands, which would displace agricultural communities and affect water supplies. These conflicts highlight the ongoing tension between different uses of Delta resources. Delta communities, including those with historical Chinese populations, face disproportionate risks from flooding, water quality issues, and infrastructure decisions. The communities that built the Delta's infrastructure now bear the risks of that infrastructure's failure, while often having limited voice in decisions about Delta management.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>The Delta remains a contested landscape balancing agriculture, water exports, habitat restoration, and community survival. Acknowledging Chinese labor foregrounds environmental justice questions about who built California's infrastructure and who bears the risks today. The Delta's transformation represents both the contributions of Chinese immigrant labor and the exclusion they faced, creating a landscape that is both a monument to their work and a site of ongoing environmental challenges.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding this history is essential for addressing contemporary Delta issues, including flood risk, water quality, habitat restoration, and community survival. The Delta's future depends on recognizing the full scope of who built its infrastructure, who has benefited from it, and who continues to bear its risks.</p>
